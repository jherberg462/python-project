# Trends about Trending YouTube Videos

This goal of this project was to look for trends and anomalies among trending videos on YouTube. After choosing our dataset, we removed data that we decided would not be useful to provide insights, cleaned the data, and combined the data into a single CSV file. Once the data was combed into a CSV file, each group member could look for interesting and useful insights from the data.   

Please run the code in the following order: get_data_into_single_csv.ipynb, cleanup2.ipynb, cleandata_dateissue.ipynb, the rest of the files. Thank you. The various plots and charts are in the Jupyter Notebooks. 

- Per Capita Views: Great Britain has the highest number, 1241, and Japan has the lowest one at  views per person.

- Top Categories and trend duration: Entertainment is the category with more views and Movies has almost no views. The mayority of views are trending in the first 2.5 days they are published.

- Likes and Dislikes: If a viewer say if they like the video, there is a 95% probability that the person likes the video, compared to a 5% of saying that does not like the video.

- Number of Views vs likes and dislikes: We did not find a relatinship between number of views and likes or dislikes.

- Number of videos trending in each country: the videos got a similar number on each of the countries we use for our analysis, except for South Korea and Japan.
